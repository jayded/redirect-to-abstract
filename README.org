* redirect-to-abstract - Firefox extension

Redirect all pdf links to their abstracts, and overwrite abstract pages to
bypass the regex (by either appending an ~&~ or ~?~ at the end of the url).

Works for the following archives:
- arxiv.org
- openreview.net
- proceedings.mlr.press
- proceedings.neurips.cc
